(Additional turn from skill can proc Rhianna again, and duplicate procs will save additional turns.) Third and reason Dust Devil is still useful is that ADDITIONAL TURNS CONSUME BUFFS. You take DoT damage faster and your defense buff expires quicker. Main reason why characters like Karin do little damage and dies easily in late game if used irresponsibly. Also works like a charm if your thief is skill dps and getting rid of non DoT debuffs as well as healing from HoT."

Synergies too well with characters like Cidd ML Karin who can assassinate a target at opening. Especially Cidd because his additional hits will gain the damage multiplier if the target died before the additional hit procced, but as this does not consume a turn, you are still stealthed and maintain multiplier for next turn. This also keeps your squishy thief safe from harm unless enemy has AoE."

      "Description (WIP)": "Tanks are usually slow because you want them to be, tanky and you usually expect tanks to take hits, which does not require a turn. But many tanks have team buffs that are vital to your survival, and this artifact helps your tank get the turn they need. Most PVE enemie do not have AoE so it works great, for PVP, having this and ML Purrgis makes enemy lose first turn fight with single attacks and AoE. Has Synergy with tanks with cooldowns as countering does not reduce your cooldown."

      "Description (WIP)": "15~30%, much higher proc rate than Rhianna. Sadly only procs on 1S, and artifact does nothing if your initial strike kills the target. After nerf, this artifact no longer procs bonus effects that combos from the 1s, such as Sez's passive or Alexa's 1s additional hit. Still very useful and sometimes even better than Rhianna for characters who rely on 1s, and has passive that empowers 1s directly, such as Cidd. Sez works well still since his 3s is saved for the final blow, but as mentioned he has to bring enemy to half health at the first hit otherwise the passive will not proc. THIS ARTIFACT DOES NOT CONSUME A TURN so buffs and DoTs do not breeze through! Lastly, THIS ACTIVATES ON FOLLOW UP ATTACK! You thought Ras + 1 was painful enough, now it is Ras + 2!"

Sadly this artifact being OP was due to a bug that resulted in 40% crit damage reduction, currently it is nerfed significantly as THIS DOES NOT STACK WITH ANY OTHER DAMAGE REDUCTION. So you can not use this with ML Arming or Aurius. The game will only apply the effect that will result in the highest damage reduction. In this sense, what happens is that this artifact does not offer defense boost to team and reduces 4% less damage and enemy has to be critting for this artifact to do its role. But that does not mean this artifact is bad. 20% damage reduction of Aurius goes to kill the tank, this will ensure even the tank gets protection."
