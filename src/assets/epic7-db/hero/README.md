# Contributing to Heroes

> Heroes are one of the main focus in this game, therefore they have a lot of information. All the information listed here is a mix of info from `Menu > Journal > Hero` and `Menu > Hero`.

> Therefore if you do not own the hero, you might not have all information.

## Important: Do not be afraid of making PR with missing data!

You might not have memory imprint rank SSS, but someone else might have and make a complementary PR to add it.
